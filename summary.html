1. Neutron stars (pulsars and magnetars): Physical processes in very strong magnetic fields, pulsar kicks
</b></font>

<ul> -- The most original work Lai did in this area concerns how strong-field QED
(vacuum birefringence) affects radiative transfer in magnetized neutron star (NS)
atmospheres/plasmas. A representative paper is 
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003ApJ...588..962L">
Transfer of Polarized Radiation in Strongly Magnetized Plasmas: Effect of Vacuum Polarization
(Lai & Ho 2003 ApJ)</a> (see also
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002ApJ...566..373L">LH02</a>).
He showed that in highly magnetized plasmas of NSs, the combined effects of plasma and
vacuum polarization gives rise to a "vacuum resonance". A polarized photon traversing the
resonance can convert from one linearly polarized mode into the other,
with dramatic change in photon opacities.
The underlying physics of this mode conversion is analogous to MSW neutrino oscillation
that takes place inside the Sun. In a series of related papers (all with students),
he showed that 
this QED-induced photon mode conversion significantly changes the observed thermal
radiation spectrum of magnetars and gives rise to a unique, clean x-ray polarization signature
even for "ordinary" magnetic NSs

In 2022-2023,
<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2216534120">
this effect may have been detected by IXPE</a>, although more work is needed
(by future x-ray polarimeter space mission like eXTP).
</ul>
<ul>
-- Lai has carried out some pioneering first-principle quantum mechanical calculations of atoms,
molecules and condensed matter in strong magnetic fields,
and have studied the magnetic field effects on the property of neutron star surfaces and
interiors and their observational implications 
(<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1991ApJ...383..745L">LS91</a>,

<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006RPPh...69.2631H">HL06</a>.
</ul>
<ul>
-- Lai has carried out some pioneering study on neutrino transfer in superstrong magentic fields,
including the effect of parity violation 
(<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998ApJ...505..844L">LQ98</a>,
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999ApJ...519..745A">AL99</a>,
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999PhRvD..60d3001A">AL99</a>).
His theoretical works have helped constrain and elucidate the
physical mechanisms of supernova kicks

<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006ApJ...639.1007W">WLH06</a>).
The paper <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001ApJ...549.1111L">CC01</a>
gives a critical assessment of various NS kick mechanisms (still up to date) and
contains the correct calculation of the electromagnetic rocket effect.

<li> 2. Accretion processes around magnetic stars and binary stars (and binary black holes)
</b></font>

<ul>
-- The most original work Lai did in this area is
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999ApJ...524.1030L">
Magnetically Driven Warping, Precession, and Resonances in Accretion Disks (Lai 1999 ApJ)
</a>, where he showed that inner region of the accretion disk onto a rotating magnetized
star (neutron star, white dwarf, or T Tauri star) is subjected to magnetic torques
  that induce warping and precession of the disk. The new magnetic effects provide
  a paragidm to explain a number of observatoinal puzzles, ranging from variabilities in
  T Tauri stars to quasi-periodic oscillations in accreting neutron stars and white dwarfs.
  They may also have implications for the observed stellar obliquities in
  (exo)planetary systems (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011MNRAS.412.2790L">LFL11</a>).
</ul>  
<ul>
-- In the last few years, Lai (with student and postdoc) initiated a series of
numerical studies on circumbinary accretion (accretion onto binary stars or binary black holes)
(<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...827...43M">ML16</a>,
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.466.1170M">MML17</a>,
<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...871...84M/abstract">MML19</a>,
<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...889..114M/abstract">MLKM20</a>).
These works reveal several new dynnamical behaviors (e.g. short and
long-term variabilities) of the accretion process. Most importantly, these works show
that a comparable-mass binary can gain angular momentum via
circumbinary accretion and therefore expands in orbit while accreting
-- this result contradicts decades-old assumptions and previous numerical works
(but has now been confirmed by more recent works from various groups), and significantly
impacts our understanding of the evolution of supermassive black-hole binaries
and the formation of binary stars.
A theoretical paper
(<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.473..603Z/abstract">ZL18</a>)
elucidates inclination evolution of disks around eccentric binaries
(some polar-aligned disks were later observed). Here is an

<li> 3. Dynamics and formation exoplanetary systems and star-planet interactions
</b></font>

<ul>  
-- Since 2010, Lai has devoted a large part of his research to
exoplanet dynamics and formation. A representative paper is 
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012MNRAS.423..486L">
Tidal dissipation in planet-hosting stars: damping of spin-orbit misalignment and survival
of hot Jupiters (Lai 2012 MNRAS)</a>, in which he showed that tidal damping of
spin-orbit misalignment can in principle involve different physical processes than
tidal decay of planetary orbit, and this difference could allow hot Jupiter's orbit to align
with the spin axis of the host star while avoiding orbital decay.
</ul>
<ul>
-- With students, Lai carried out comprehensive studies on 
the formation of hot Jupiters through high-eccentricity migration via Lidov-Kozai effects
(<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.456.3671A">ASL16</a>,
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.460.1086M">MLL16</a> and

and "secular chaos" effect
(<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.486.2265T/abstract">TLV19</a>).
Most significantly, he showed that stellar spin dynamics (often
chaotic) driven by migrating planets plays a crucial role in
determining the observed stellar obliquities
(<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014Sci...345.1317S">SAL14 Science</a>,
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.456.3671A">ASL16</a>),
and developed the corresponding 
theory of "spin chaos due to overlapping resonances"
(<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.448.1821S">SL15</a>,
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.465.3927S">SL17</a>) that explain the
numerical results. A recent work along these lines may provide an explanation for the observed
"perpendicular hot Jupiters"
(<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...943L..13V/abstract">VSL23</a>.

<ul>
-- Lai has explored several new mechanisms of producing spin-orbit
misalignments in exoplanetary systems, which shed light on the formation and evolution
of these systems: magnetic effect

<li> 4. Sources of Gravitational Waves
</b></font>

<ul>
-- Lai has made original contributions to the understanding of
hydrodynamical processes in coalescing neutron star binaries:
he gave the first complete analytic expression of
gravitational wave (GW) phase shift due to 
static tides (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994ApJ...420..811L">LRS94</a>)
and discovered the related tidal instability
(<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993ApJ...406L..63L">LRS93</a>,
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996PhRvD..54.3958L">LW96</a>,
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000ApJ...532..530W">WL00</a>)
-- these can be used to constrain the tidal deformability and equation of state
of neutron stars using GWs;
he pioneered the study of resonant tides and tidal heating

<ul>
-- With student, Lai has studied dynamical tides in compact binary white dwarfs
(<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012MNRAS.421..426F">FL12</a>), heartbeat stars 
(<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012MNRAS.420.3126F">FL12</a>)
and highly eccentric binaries
(<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997ApJ...490..847L">L97</a>).
A recent work elucidates the dynamics of "chaotic tides"
(<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.476..482V">VL18</a>).

<ul>
-- Lai developed the theory of corotational excitation of global oscillations of accretion 
disks around black holes in an attempt to understand QPOs 
(<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009MNRAS.393..979L">LT09</a>,

alas, BH accretion disks are messy...).
</ul>

mechansim to explain the small frequency splitting of Saturn's oscillation modes
(<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014Icar..231...34F/abstract">FLS14</a>)

computed Sun's obliquity generated by putative Planet 9
