Astro 6511: Research Projects
</font></font></b></center>

<p> About 30% of the course grade will be based on "project".
  (both grade and SU students should do the project).

<p> For the project, you will read/study/research on a topic of your
  choice related to the course subject, and write a short report on
  it.  We will also have an oral presentation session for your porjects.
  The purpose is to give you a chance to dip into a subject
  that is otherwise covered inadequately or not covered at all in
  class.

<p> Some suggested topics are listed below. (You can also choose your own topics, but 
all topics must be approved by the lecturer in advance.) I will coordinate the
choice of topics among the students so that everybody will have
a different project. I suggest that you let me know your
topic by email as early as possible, and certainly no later than April 20.

<p> Below are some suggested topics (in no particular order).
The papers are chosen to give you a lead into the related literatures;
they are NOT necessarily the best papers on the subject or the papers
you should focus on.  For theoretical topics, it may be good to
concentrate on one or two classical papers and try to understand them
as best as you can. For observation-oriented topics, you should try
to discuss recent development on the subject related to the paper
(this can be done by searching ADS on recent papers that cite the
older paper). You should not choose a topic that you are already
familiar with, but take this as an opportunity to become an expert on
some subject that you are interested in. If you do an observational
project, you should not only report the observational facts, but also
look into the some of physical processes and interpretation behind the
observation.

Presentation and Writeup
</font></font></b>
  
<p>
Each student will give a 20 minutes presentation
on your topic using overhead projector (with powerpoint etc).
This is your chance to report
to the class what you have learned.
By the time you give the talk, you should have already done
essentially all your reading/research, and should at least have a
rough draft of your writeup.

<p> The date of the presentation is May 12 (Monday), 10 am - 12:20 pm in Rm 622 of SSB.

<p> You will write a report on your project.
The report is essentially a self-contained, expanded "transcript"
of your presentaton, with referenecs and/or any supplementary
material.  The main text of your paper should be 5-8 ApJ-like pages
(including all figures and references), and should be in the format
like a real ApJ paper (single spaced, double-column).
You can add whatever supplementary material that you like
(e.g. your note) in an appendix.
I strongly suggest that you use the ApJ template file that
  emulates the published version of the journal.
  Please see  https://journals.aas.org/manuscript-preparation/.

<p>The paper/report will be due on May 15 -- Please email me a single pdf file.
