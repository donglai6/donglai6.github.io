Astro 6511: Research Projects
</font></font></b></center>

<p> About 35% of the course grade will be based on "project".
  (both grade and SU students should do the project).

<p> For the project, you will read/study/research on a topic of your
  choice related to the course subject, and write a short report on
  it.  We will also arrange oral presentation sessions for your
  porjects.  (The report is essentially a self-contained, expanded
  "transcript" of your presentaton, with referenecs). The purpose is
  to give you a chance to dip into a subject that is otherwise covered
  inadequately or not covered at all in class.

<p> The date of the presentation will be on XX (around the last day of class).
  The report (pdf file) will be due a few days after (TBD).
  
<p> Some suggested topics are listed below. (You can also choose your own topics, but 
all topics must be approved in advance.) I will coordinate the
choice of topics among the students so that everybody will have
a different project. I suggest that you let me know your
topic as early as possible, and certainly no later than XXX (TBD).

<p> Below are some suggested topics (in no particular order) from 2022.
  The papers are chosen to give you a lead into the related literatures and
they are NOT necessarily the best papers on the subject or the papers
you should focus on.  For very theoretical topics, it is good to
concentrate on one or two classical papers and try to understand them
as best as you can. For observation-oriented topics, you should try
to discuss recent development on the subject related to the paper
(this can be done by searching ADS on recent papers that cite the
older paper). You should not choose a topic that you are already
familiar with, but take this as an opportunity to become an expert on
some subject that you are interested in. If you do an observational
project, you should not only report the observational fact, but also
look into the some of physical processes and interpretation behind the
observation.

"target="_blank"> TDE review: S.Gezari
</a>: 
  "TDEs" has become a big topic now. I suggest you focus on Section 4, or part of it, and
  try to understand the current unsolved problems (tensions between theory and observations)
  -- you may need to consult relevant papers that are cited in the review.
