<p><b><font color="#229999">Description:</font></b>

<p>
This is a one-semester lecture course on high energy astrophysics,
with focus on compact stars and related subjects (including supermassive 
black holes). Contemporary research problems will be discussed along the
way. An important component of the course is to 
introduce/survey (generally in a quick and ``low-brow'' manner) the
physics tools needed for understanding various astrophysical
observations. Major topics to be covered include gravitational wave astrophysics
(e.g. LIGO/LISA/PTA sources) and various EM transient phenomena (supernovae,
GRBs and FRBs, TDEs, etc).


<p>
The course is aimed at graduate students in astronomy and physics;
senior undergraduates with strong physics background may also take it.
The minimum prerequisites for this course are all of the physics 
at the upper division undergraduate level. (The more basic physics
you have had at the graduate level, the easier the course will be for you.)
No prior knowledge of General relativity is required -- Practical GR will be introduced
along the way during the semester. Though helpful, no astronomy background is needed.

<p><b><font color="#229999">Organization:</font></b>
<p>
Weekly lectures. There will be about 6-8 problem sets.
No final exam (the last problem set may serve as take-home final exam).
There will a student project during the second half of the semester (TBD).
Grades will be determined by these HWs, project and participations in class.
Either Letter or S/U grade option is possible. (S = attend lectures and do
70% of HWs and project with passing grades)

(suggested reading from ST=Shapiro-Teukolsky, etc,
plus review papers.  Note that I'll try to choose easier (shorter) papers that could be
read by most people. If you are interested in digging deeper into 
a particular topic, ask me!)
