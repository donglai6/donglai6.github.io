<p>
Three-credit lecture course, aimed at general astrophysics/physics/engineering 
graduate students as well as well-prepared undergraduate students.

<p>
A knowledge of fluid dynamics is essential for understanding many of
the most interesting problems in astrophysics (and applied physical
sciences).  This course will survey fluid dynamics (including
magnetohydrodynamics and some plasma physics -- time permitting)
important for understanding various astronomical and terrestrial
phenomena. Topics include basic fluid and MHD concepts and equations,
waves and instabilities of various types (e.g., sound, gravity,
Rossby, hydromagnetic, spiral density waves; Rayleigh-Taylor, thermal,
Jeans, rotational, magnetorotational instabilities), shear and viscous
flows, turbulence, shocks and blast waves, etc. These topics will be
discussed in different astrophysical contexts and applications, such
as atmosphere and ocean, star and planet formation, stellar
oscillation/rotation/magnetism, compact objects, interstellar medium,
galaxies and clusters. This course is intended mainly for graduate
students (both theory and observation) interested in astrophysics and
space physics. Students in other areas of applied science and
engineering may find the broad astrophysical and terrestrial
applications useful. Well-prepared undergradate students may also take
the course. No previous exposure to fluid dynamics and astronomy is
required.

<p> The students should be familiar with classical mechanics and
  electrodynamics at the intermediate (junior) level, and should be
  comfortable with vector calculus (e.g. divergence and curl of a vector).


<p><b><font color="#229999">Organization:</font></b>
<p>
Weekly lectures. There will be about 6-8 problem sets. 
No final exam (the last problem set may serve as take-home final exam).
There may be a student project during the second half of the semester (TBD).
Grades will be determined by these HWs, project and participations in class.
Either Letter or S/U grade option is possible. (S = attend lectures and do
70% of HWs with passing grades)


<p>
Policy statement: You should abide by the CU Code of Academic
Integrity. You are encouraged to discuss homework with other
students but not to collaborate on writing up the notebook
solutions (and not to copy). Anything that you turn in should be your own
work (homework, project). If you need any academic accommodations
please register with Student Disability Services at the beginning of the
term and bring me the description of the appropriate
accommodations.
